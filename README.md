### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Java developer experienced in working with Minecraft server & the Bukkit API.
I started learning Java around 2 years ago, and have worked on commissioned projects for a little over a year now. 
My past experience includes working on small plugins, popular network servers, and large YouTuber videos.
